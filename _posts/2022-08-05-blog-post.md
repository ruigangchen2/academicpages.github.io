As we all know, Linux systems aren't true real-time systems. Sometimes, the system might prioritize other tasks, causing delays in processing user programs. This can be a problem, especially when using Linux-based boards like the Orange Pi to debug peripherals like the MPU6050, which can lead to program lag.

In this blog, instead of going the route of applying real-time patches directly, weâ€™ll focus on improving system real-time performance by allocating specific cores. This approach can help mitigate lag and enhance the responsiveness of your setup.
